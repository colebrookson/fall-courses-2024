# Demo Code

A demo code is available in **/src/print_demo**. This code is useful for printing numbers to the screen later in the class. Please see the readme file there.
Try to run the demo code. It has examples of most of what we need.
The demo includes a script that compiles the code, runs it, and save the output to a log file.
You can use our server if the code doesn’t run as is on your own computer.

## Programming in C

Here are some examples:

You can choose any tutorial or book. Here are some examples:
* [https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/]( https://www.w3schools.in/c-tutorial/ )
* [https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c-tutorial.html)


Note: **we will use C99**. *Do NOT use tutorials for C++* and other languages. 

What you need:
1. Basic program structure
2. If. Logical expressions.
3. For loop
4. Break (in for loops)
5. Arrays (one dimensional)
6. Functions
7. Pointers, "\*", "&" (*but not dynamic memory allocation*)
8. Printing to the screen (try out printing functions in the demo code too!)
9. Variables of type: int, double, char (and arrays of these, and pointers to these)

What you **don't** need for now:
1. While loop
2. High dimensional arrays (we may need these later)
3. Struct
4. File i/o, keyboard input
5. Command line parameters
6. Dynamic memory allocation (malloc)
7. Switch case



## Programming in Fortran

You can use Fortran instead of C (it's actually better for this course for reasons we will discuss later). There are standard compilers that allow you to mix C functions and Fortran functions in the same program very easily.


You can use any tutorial or book. 
Here are examples: [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran ) , [https://web.stanford.edu/class/me200c/tutorial_77/](https://web.stanford.edu/class/me200c/tutorial_77/). [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran/Fortran_examples](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Fortran/Fortran_examples)

Note: we will use **Fortran 77**. 

What you need to know:
1. Basic program structure
2. Subroutines (and call by reference)
3. If, logical expressions
4. Do loops
5. Go to 
6. Array (One dimensional, we will discuss 2-D later)
7. Printing to screen (try our demo code)

What you *don't* need
1. While, until loops
2. Functions (you _do_ need subroutines!)
3. Common blocks
4. File i/o, reading from the keyboard, format statements




## Python Tutorials

We will start using python about half-way through the course.


* Standard Python Tutorial: [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ )

* Quickstart Tutorial for Numpy: [https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)

* Optional: Numpy matlib library: [https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.matlib.html](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.matlib.html) (matrices are essentially 2-D arrays in numpy. There are some advantages in using matrices)

* Scripting in Python (By Rob Bjornson - Yale Sessions on Campus(!) and prerecorded sessions): 
[https://research.computing.yale.edu/training/intro-python](https://research.computing.yale.edu/training/intro-python)

* More about working with data and numpy (also on campus(!), with examples online):
https://research.computing.yale.edu/training/ycrc-bootcamps/ycrc-bootcamp-data-analysis-python

You sould be comfortable with the material in the standard python tutorial (above) roughly up to the end of section 4 ASAP.
IN ADDITION, you should be comfortable with most of the Numpy Quickstart Tutorial and take a look at the matlib library. 

The Yale Tutorials are great, but cover slightly different topics. I recommend attending both, or at least viewing Rob's tutorial (although he covers aspects of working with text files that are less relevant to our course).
